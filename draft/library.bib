Although monopolists can only increase profits by price discriminating,  this need not be true when firms face competition. With novel data covering the retail home-improvement industry, we find that Home Depot would benefit from finer pricing but that  Lowe's would prefer coarser pricing. Zone pricing softens competition in markets where firms compete, but it shields consumers from higher prices in rural markets, where firms might  otherwise exercise market power. Overall, zone pricing produces higher consumer surplus than finer price discrimination does.},

Thus far, legal theories that have been inconsistent with economic theories have dictated enforcement across jurisdictions, which has led to confusion that thwarts potentially efficient business practices. This paper distinguishes issues of online RPM from traditional RPM and online RPM from online MFN. We apply the economics learning to RPM and analyze the antitrust cases of online RPM and MFN to date in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

Special cases of this setting have been extensively studied in recent literature, notably the static assortment planning problem. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the general formulation is not known to admit efficient algorithms with analytical performance guarantees before this work, and most of its computational aspects are still wide open. In this paper, we devise what is, to our knowledge, the first provably good approximation algorithm for dynamic assortment planning under the MNL model. We derive a constant-factor guarantee for a broad class of demand distributions that satisfy the increasing failure rate property. Our algorithm relies on a combination of greedy procedures, where stocking decisions are restricted to specific classes of products and the objective function takes modified forms. We demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods in terms of performance and speed, leading to an average revenue gain of 4\% to 12\% in computational experiments. In the course of establishing our main result, we develop new algorithmic ideas that may be of independent interest. These include weaker notions of submodularity and monotonicity, shown sufficient to obtain constant-factor worst-case guarantees, despite using noisy estimates of the objective function.},

We use examples to show that the Nash value functions defined on the joint inventory vector are likely to be ill-behaved. In particular, they need not be concave nor even continuous in the firm's own inventory. As a result, asymmetric equilibrium is possible. When average production costs are falling, single-firm operation can occur in equilibrium. Nonexistence is also a distinct possibility.},

In a lost sales environment, where the arrival process is not recorded, the exact demand is not observed if it exceeds the beginning stock level, resulting in censored observations. Adopting a Bayesian approach for updating the demand distribution, we develop expressions for the exact posteriors starting with conjugate priors, for negative binomial, gamma, Poisson and normal distributions. Having shown that non-informative priors result in degenerate predictive densities except for negative binomial demand, we propose an approximation within the conjugate family by matching the first two moments of the posterior distribution. The conjugacy property of the priors also ensure analytical tractability and ease of computation in successive updates. In our numerical study, we show that the posteriors and the predictive demand distributions obtained exactly and with the approximation are very close to each other, and that the approximation works very well from both probabilistic and operational perspectives in a sequential updating setting as well.},

Einheitliche Einzelhandelspreise verst{\"a}rken die Anreize f{\"u}r absatzfordernde MaBnahmen seitens des Einzelhandels, verhindern jedoch Preisdiskriminierung nach Vertriebskanal.

  abstract = {An important current trend in advertising is the replacement of traditional pay-per-exposure (pay-per-impression) pricing models with performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers. Such pay-per-action (PPA) mechanisms are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, pay-per-call, and pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hitherto unrecognized, side effect of PPA advertising. I find that, if the prices of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, PPA mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upward) relative to prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold under pay-per-exposure methods. Upward price distortions reduce both consumer surplus and the joint publisher--advertiser profit, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist in current auction-based PPA mechanisms, such as the ones used by Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft. In the latter settings they also reduce publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods. I show that these phenomena constitute a form of double marginalization and discuss a number of enhancements to today's PPA mechanisms that restore equilibrium pricing of advertised goods to efficient levels, improving both consumer surplus as well as the publisher's expected profits.

Demand estimates reveal substantial within-chain variation in price elasticities and suggest that the median chain sacrifices \$\{{\textbackslash}\$\}\$16 million of annual profit relative to a benchmark of optimal prices. In contrast, differences in average prices between chains are broadly consistent with the optimal benchmark. We discuss a range of explanations for nearly uniform pricing, highlighting managerial inertia and brand image concerns as mechanisms frequently mentioned by industry participants. Relative to our optimal benchmark, uniform pricing may significantly increase the prices paid by poorer households relative to the rich, dampen the response of prices to local economic shocks, alter the analysis of mergers in antitrust, and shift the incidence of intranational trade costs.},

We show that agency contracts can lead to higher or lower retail prices than wholesale contracts depending on the distribution of bargaining power. We propose a methodology to structurally estimate a model with either contract form under Nash-in-Nash bargaining. We apply our model to the e-book industry, which transitioned from wholesale to agency contracts after the expiration of a ban on agency contracting imposed in the antitrust settlement between U.S. Department of Justice and the major publishers. Using a unique dataset of e-book prices, we show that the transition to agency contracting increased Amazon prices substantially but had little effect on Barnes \& Noble prices. We find that the assumption of Nash-in-Nash bargaining explains the data better than an assumption of take-it or leave-it input contracts. Counterfactual simulations indicate that reinstitution of most favored nation clauses, which were banned for five years in the 2012 settlement, would raise the prices of non-fiction books by nearly nine percent.},

  abstract = {This paper empirically analyzes how the use of vertical price restraints has impacted retail prices in the market for e-books. In 2010, five of the six largest publishers simultaneously adopted the agency model of book sales, allowing them to directly set retail prices. This led the Department of Justice to file suit against the publishers in 2012, the settlement of which prevents the publishers from interfering with retailers' ability to set e-book prices. Using a unique dataset of daily e-book prices for a large sample of books across major online retailers, we exploit cross-publisher variation in the timing of the return to the wholesale model to estimate its effect on retail prices. We find that e-book prices for titles that were previously sold using the agency model decreased by 18 percent at Amazon and 8 percent at Barnes \& Noble. Our results are robust to different specifications, placebo tests, and synthetic control groups. Our findings illustrate a case where upstream firms prefer to set higher retail prices than retailers and help to clarify conflicting theoretical predictions on agency versus wholesale models.},

  abstract = {Retail chains essentially practice one of two broad strategies in setting prices across their stores. The more straightforward is to set a chain- or country- wide price. Alternatively, managers of retail chains may customize prices to the store level according to local demand and competitive conditions. For example, a chain may price lower in a location with lower demand and/or more competition. However, despite having the ability to customize prices to local market conditions, some choose instead to commit to uniform pricing with a ``one price policy'' across their entire store network. As an illustration, we focus on UK supermarket chains. Is there an advantage to be gained from deliberately choosing not to price discriminate across locations? We show generally and illustrate through means of a specific model that there exists a strategic incentive to soften competition in competitive markets by committing not to customize prices at the store level and instead adopt uniform pricing across the store network, and to raise overall profits thereby. Furthermore, we characterize quite precisely the circumstances under which uniform pricing is, and is not, profitable and illustrate that under a range of circumstances uniform pricing may be the preferable strategy.},

To ensure that there exists a computationally tractable Markov-perfect equilibrium, we introduce firm heterogeneity in the form of randomly drawn, privately known scrap values and setup costs into the model. Our game of incomplete information always has an equilibrium in cutoff entry/exit strategies. In contrast, the existence of an equilibrium in the Ericson and Pakes' model of industry dynamics requires admissibility of mixed entry/exit strategies, contrary to the assertion in their article, that existing algorithms cannot cope with. In addition, we provide a condition on the model's primitives that ensures that the equilibrium is in pure investment strategies. Building on this basic existence result, we first show that a symmetric equilibrium exists under appropriate assumptions on the model's primitives. Second, we show that, as the distribution of the random scrap values/setup costs becomes degenerate, equilibria in cutoff entry/exit strategies converge to equilibria in mixed entry/exit strategies of the game of complete information.},

We propose a new estimator for the Random-Coefficients Logit demand system for purchase datasets with zero-valued market shares. The identification of the demand parameters is based on a pairwise-differencing approach that constructs moment conditions based on differences in demand between pairs of products. The corresponding estimator corrects non-parametrically for the potential selection of the incidence of zeros on unobserved aspects of demand. The estimator also corrects for the potential endogeneity of marketing variables both in demand and in the selection propensities. Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed estimator provides reliable small-sample inference both with and without selection-on- unobservables. In an empirical case study, the proposed estimator not only generates different demand estimates than approaches that ignore selection in the incidence of zero shares, it also generates better out-of-sample fit of observed retail contribution margins.},

Despite the rich theoretical analysis of this type of vertical restraint, evidence on the rationales of ED remains scarce. This paper uses a simple model to survey the vast theoretical literature on ED, and identifies two opposing motivations for ED contracts: anti-competitive versus efficiency-enhancing motivations. The theoretical predictions are subject to empirical investigation using unique French cross-sectional data encompassing diverse retail sectors. Our estimations provide evidence for both types of motivations for ED contracts, manifesting in different contexts. In particular, we find that the efficiency-enhancing motivation is more likely to explain the choice of ED when suppliers are less concentrated, whereas the anti-competitive motivation is present in highly standardized product markets. Moreover, our results reveal a positive linkage of ED and different types of investments, as part of branding strategy, with important retailing and marketing-related implications. In particular, we show that retailers have to be meticulous regarding the conditions of the retail contract before accepting the ED restriction, which may dampen their business efficiency in the long run.},

Discounts by retailers would fail to compensate. Evidence provides some support for this explanation.

  abstract = {Fixed book price (FBP) is a form of resale price maintenance applied to books. It allows publishers to determine the price of a book at which it is to be sold to the public. FBP can take the form of a law, mandatory to oblige by all retailers, or an agreement between publishers and booksellers. An example of a fixed book price law is French Lang Law and the German Buchpreisbindung. An example of a trade agreement is the former Net Book Agreement in the United Kingdom. The key idea of an FBP is to promote non-price competition between booksellers in order to promote the sale of little-known, difficult or otherwise culturally interesting books rather than catering only to blockbuster readers. To do so, an FBP is deemed to ensure that the booksellers that provide the corresponding presale services are able to recoup their higher costs with a guaranteed margin on blockbusters. Fixed book price systems, with various provisos, have existed in some developed countries since the beginning of the twentieth century. They remain in force in one third member states of the European Union as well as in some other countries. Despite the name, most fixed book price laws and agreements actually set minimum prices, allowing sellers to deviate from a price set by publishers by a small degree. Thus they are only limiting price competition, not suppressing it entirely.},

We show that the agency model may not be universally adopted even if adoption would mean higher profits for all firms. Use of most-favored-nation clauses in these settings can ensure industry-wide adoption and increase retail prices.},

We show first that even when (Ut ) is arbitrary, dynamic random utility imposes new testable across-period restrictions on behavior, over and above period-by-period analogs of the static random utility axioms. An important feature of dynamic random utility is that behavior may appear historydependent, because period-t choices reveal information about Ut, which may be serially correlated; however, our key new axioms highlight that the model entails specific limits on the form of history dependence that can arise. Second, we show that imposing natural Bayesian rationality axioms restricts the form of randomness that (Ut ) can display. By contrast, a specification of utility shocks that is widely used in empirical work violates these restrictions, leading to behavior that may display a negative option value and can produce biased parameter estimates. Finally, dynamic stochastic choice data allow us to characterize important special cases of random utility---in particular, learning and taste persistence---that on static domains are indistinguishable from the general model.},

We further show that there is an equivalence between (a) max RPM and two-part tariff contracts with positive fixed fees, and (b) min RPM and two-part tariff contracts with negative fixed fees (i.e., slotting allowances).

The implication that this both reduces firm profits and harms consumers is known as the double-marginalization problem. Many solutions have been proposed to help sellers mitigate this pricing problem, and it is arguably one of the main reasons why quantity discounts in the distribution channel are as prevalent as they are. Surprisingly, however, the implication that end-user prices will be distorted upward has only been shown under a very restrictive set of circumstances (successive monopoly). Whether and under what conditions double marginalization is a problem in other, more realistic settings is generally unknown. In this paper, we show that double marginalization need not be a problem when an upstream firm sells its product through competing intermediaries and shelf space is costly. When this is the case, we find that there will often be a role for slotting fees, minimum resale price maintenance (min RPM), and minimum advertised pricing (MAP) policies.},

Zeroes in demand are a common problem in differentiated product markets, but fall outside the scope of existing demand estimation techniques. We show that with a lower bound imposed on the expected sales quantities, we can construct upper and lower bounds for the conditional expectation of the inverse demand. These bounds can be translated into moment inequalities that are shown to yield consistent and asymptotically normal point estimators for demand parameters under natural conditions. In Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the new approach works well even when the fraction of zeroes is as high as 95\%. We apply our estimator to supermarket scanner data and find that correcting the bias caused by zeroes has important empirical implications, e.g., price elasticities become twice as large when zeroes are properly controlled.},

It is also shown to depend on the number of firms in each oligopoly and on the type of interaction that is assumed between firms that are integrated and firms that are not. In particular, it is shown that if no restriction is put on trade between integrated and nonintegrated firms, integrated firms may continue to purchase inputs from the nonintegrated upstream firms, with the goal of raising their downstream rivals' costs. Furthermore, even though firms are identical, asymmetric equilibria, where integrated and nonintegrated firms coexist, may actually arise as an outcome of the integration game.},

Since retailers are not required to actually return unsold copies, it is said that some of them occasionally under-report sales. That hurts the publisher on the short run and could also interfere with his rational stocking decisions as these are based, to some extent, on previous sales reports. We construct a discounted dynamic framework for the retailer's optimal reporting as a function of the publisher's delivery--response function to these reports, and a similar average-cost model. It turns out the optimal report does not depend on actual sales. We then show that the publisher's resulting delivery response function is the same as it would be in an integrated system. Thus the retailer's untruthful behavior actually causes the system to behave optimally. Had the retailer been verifiably truthful, the system would not be coordinated.},

Amazon's aggressive (low) pricing of e-books led to allegations that e-books were bankrupting brick and mortar book booksellers.  Amazon's commanding position as a bookseller also raises concerns about monopoly power, and publishers are concerned about Amazon's power to displace them in the book value chain.  I find little evidence that e-books are primarily responsible for the decline of independent booksellers.  I also conclude that entry barriers are not sufficient to allow Amazon to set monopoly prices.  Publishers are at risk from Amazon's monopsony (buyer) power and so sought "agency" pricing in an effort to raise the price of ebooks, promote retail competition, and reduce Amazon's influence as an e-retailer.  (In the agency pricing model, the publisher specifies the retail price with a commission for the retailer.  In a traditional, "wholesale" pricing model, publishers sell a book to retailers at a wholesale price and retailers set the retail price.)  Although agency pricing was challenged by the Department of Justice, it may yet prevail in some form as an equilibrium pricing model for e-book sales.},

We consider inventory record inaccuracy in a supply chain model, where a Stackelberg manufacturer sets the wholesale price and a retailer determines how much to stock for sale to customers. We first analyze the impact of inventory record inaccuracy on optimal stocking decisions and profits. By contrasting optimal decisions in a decentralized supply chain with those in an integrated supply chain, we find that inventory record inaccuracy exacerbates the inefficiencies resulting from double marginalization in decentralized supply chains. Assuming RFID technology can eliminate the problem of inventory record inaccuracy, we determine the cost thresholds at which RFID adoption becomes profitable. We show that a decentralized supply chain benefits more from RFID technology, such that RFID adoption improves supply chain coordination.},

We show that a resale price floor increases the total profit of the upstream monopoly when transport cost (product differentiation) is relatively low. Importantly, this profitable RPM floor can also enhance social welfare and even consumer surplus. A resale price ceiling can also be profitable and always improves consumer surplus and social welfare. We argue that such findings support a rule of reason approach to RPM.},

Multiplexes, however, typically charge the same price for all movies, except for such premium formats as 3D, a choice that has puzzled managers and researchers. Because of data limitations, minimal empirical work has directly addressed this issue. In Hong Kong, however, prices vary both within and across multiplexes. Using daily ticket prices and attendance by theater and movie, the authors empirically examine the potential gains from differentiated movie-specific pricing as well as the increasingly common two-tier (2D/3D) uniform pricing, as compared with a full uniform pricing strategy in which a theater charges the same price for all its movies. Their results show that differential pricing leads to higher profits than the two-tier uniform pricing practice, but that the improvement is limited. In contrast, the gains are substantial when compared with the full uniform pricing strategy, suggesting that only minimal differentiation (2D/3D) may obtain most of the gains available from fully differentiated prices.},

In our model, total customer demand is random and comprises fixed proportion of customers of different types. Customer preferences are modeled through the definition of these types. Each customer type corresponds to a specific preference ordering among products. A customer purchases the highest-ranked product, according to his type (if any), that is available at the time of his visit to the store (stockout-based substitution). We solve the optimal assortment problem using a dynamic programming formulation. We establish structural properties of the value function of the dynamic program that, in particular, help to characterize multiple local maxima. We use the properties of the optima to solve the problem in pseudopolynomial time. Our algorithm also gives a heuristic for the general case, i.e., when the proportion of customers of each type is random. In numerical tests, this heuristic performs better and faster than previously known methods, especially when the mean demand is large, the degree of substitutability is high, the population is homogeneous, or prices and/or costs vary across products.},

The article uses both ex ante and ex post tests to distinguish the theories, including tests based on structural evidence, as well as data on sales, advertising, and stock market reactions for the company and its competitors around critical events in the case. The evidence most convincingly rejects the anticompetitive theories and points toward a principle-agent explanation in which RPM helped increase sales of Corning's products. The case is of interest, in part, because the "simple" products at issue in the case are not the types of products most often associated with potential efficiency explanations for RPM.}

Nevertheless, manufacturers in more competitive wholesale markets may not have an incentive to reveal their prices to consumers.

The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.},

We control for title-municipality-specific, months-after-publication-specific, and municipality-month-specific unobserved heterogeneities. We found that overall crowding-out effects exist. Moreover, we found the the effects to be highly progressive: the effects are stronger for popular titles. The total loss in revenue during the data period is 17.5\% of actual sales revenue, which is higher than public libraries' expenditure on books (5\%). The estimates indicate that the prevailing PLR rates are overly low to compensate for losses for popular books but that this could be a pure subsidy to other books.},

Then, it identifies the challenges faced by managers in practice and discusses the conditions under which workers follow the algorithm.

The experiment shows that, on average, workers are reluctant to follow the algorithmic advice; however, the workers are more willing to conform once their forecasts are integrated into the algorithm. Analyses using nonexperimental variations highlight the importance of taking worker and context heterogeneity into account to maximize the benefit from adopting a new algorithm. Higher worker's regret, sales volatility, and fewer delegations increase the conformity, while they mitigate the effects of integration. Workers avoid high-traffic vending machines and focus on machines with high sales volatility when adopting the algorithm. The effects on the sales are largely similar to the effects on product assortments. The results emphasize the gap between nominal and actual performance of an algorithm and several practical issues to be resolved.},

The firms are assumed to face a random demand so they hold inventories which fluctuate from one period to the next. This necessitates a dynamic model rather than a static one. Our extension of the equilibrium concept to the oligopoly model is founded on recent generalizations of Shapley's stochastic game. We show the existence of equilibrium price-quantity strategies for the firms and also (i) an equilibrium strategy may be found by solving an appropriate static game and (ii) the quantity part of the strategy is often a constant (time invariant).},

  abstract = {The Supreme Court in State Oil Company v. Khan focused on the control of "successive monopoly" problems as the sole pro-competitive rationale for maximum vertical resale price maintenance. This article shows that the circumstances that lead a manufacturer to use maximum resale price maintenance are much more complex than the presence of a negatively sloped dealer demand curve and that these more complex conditions must be considered in order to explain Khan. The analysis first demonstrates that there are important reasons other than the "classic dealer free riding" emphasized in economics and case law for why an incentive incompatibility may exist between a manufacturer and its dealers. Therefore, to enforce dealer performance distribution arrangements must create and preserve a dealer profit premium. This explains why maximum resale price maintenance is not ubiquitous and suggests that to understand Khan we must examine other pro-competitive reasons for maximum resale price maintenance. Maximum resale price maintenance was used in Khan to prevent gasoline dealers from taking advantage of the fact that regular gas sales, but not premium gas sales, are related to convenience store sales. Hence, unconstrained dealers have the incentive to shift their demand away from the supplier's higher margin premium gas towards regular gas. This analysis illustrates the difficulties courts would have if they were required to undertake a full rule of reason analysis of every distribution arrangement that used maximum resale price maintenance. Instead, the article recommends that rule of reason analysis should employ a manufacturer market power screen.},

Consequently, manufacturers must compensate retailers for devoting their valuable retail assets to the sale of a manufacturer's products, and resale price maintenance often is an efficient way to accomplish this.

Furthermore we argue that the term ``bidding market'' as it is widely used in antitrust is unhelpful or misleading. Auctions and bidding processes do have some special features -- including their price formation processes, common-values behaviour, and bid-taker power -- but the significance of these features has been overemphasized, and they often imply a need for stricter rather than more lenient competition policy.},

This paper studies the influence of digital products on existing channels and the optimal multichannel management strategy in the context of the book industry. Using individual-level online transaction data and county-level offline bookstore data, I estimate a demand model of book format and retailer choices across genres. I use the estimates to solve for publishers' optimal wholesale pricing strategy across channels. The demand-side estimates reveal that e-books and offline bookstores appear to compete head-to-head in book genres that serve casual reading purposes such as fiction, science fiction, humor, and biographies, which I categorize as ``casual'' books. The supply-side results suggest that as local bookstore availability increases, publishers should charge higher wholesale prices in the offline print channel, especially for ``casual'' books. I find that the e-book channel does not always hurt print channels but can serve as a strategic complement and enhance the pricing power of print channels in some markets and genres; this complementarity does not rely on branding or marketing communication and crucially depends on the relative strength of the channels. Specifically, a new channel can help an existing channel when two conditions hold: first, the new channel is not too weak and can generate enough market expansion effect; second, the existing channel is not too strong and can avoid too much cannibalization from the new channel. I use counterfactual analysis to illustrate the mechanism behind this result and how a multichannel management strategy should account for relative strength across channels.},

Examples are provided to illustrate the application of our findings to specific industrial domains. Moreover, our coordination mechanisms are shown to be applicable to the multi-supplier situation, which fills the research gap on assembly system coordination with random yield and random demand under a voluntary compliance regime.},

Using individual-level data (2008--2012), I estimate a dynamic demand model for e-reader adoption and subsequent book quantity, reading format, and retailer choices in several book genres. I use the estimates to simulate a monopolist's optimal dynamic pricing strategies when facing forward-looking consumers. The results illustrate how skimming/penetration pricing incentives for e-readers and harvesting/investing incentives for e-books interact in this novel setting. The optimal joint IPD strategy is skimming for e-readers and investing for e-books. Counterfactual results suggest that combining IPD with complementary product pricing improves firm profitability because it attenuates the limitations of each pricing approach. In a single-product IPD setting, firms' pricing power is limited when consumers anticipate future price changes and delay purchases. Adding complementary products offers firms two pricing instruments; opposite price trajectories provide conflicting incentives for consumers, limiting intertemporal arbitrage. In a static complementary product setting, firms' pricing power is limited when the relative elasticity between the two products is heterogeneous and conflicting among consumers. Adding IPD sorts heterogeneous consumers into different periods and reduces the need to balance across consumer types.This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.},

The customer choice decisions are based on a natural and classical utility maximization criterion. Faced with such substitution behavior, the retailer must choose initial inventory levels for the assortment to maximize expected profits. Using a sample path analysis, we analyze structural properties of the expected profit function. We show that, under very general assumptions on the demand process, total sales of each product are concave in their own inventory levels and possess the so-called decreasing differences property, meaning that the marginal value of an additional unit of the given product is decreasing in the inventory levels of all other products. For a continuous relaxation of the problem, we then show, via counterexamples, that the expected profit function is in general not even quasiconcave. Thus, global optimization may be difficult. However, we propose and analyze a stochastic gradient algorithm for the problem, and prove that it converges to a stationary point of the expected profit function under mild conditions. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a set of numerical examples and compare the resulting inventory decisions to those of some simpler, naive heuristics. The examples show that substitution effects can have a significant impact on an assortment's gross profits. The examples also illustrate some systematic distortions in inventory decisions if substitution effects are ignored. In particular, under substitution one should stock relatively more of popular variants and relatively less of unpopular variants than a traditional newsboy analysis indicates.},

  abstract = {Integrating inventory and assortment planning decisions is a challenging task that requires comparing the value of demand expansion through broader choice for consumers with the value of higher in-stock availability. We develop a stockout-based substitution model for trading off these values in a setting with inventory replenishment, a feature missing in the literature. Using the closed form solution for the single-product case, we develop an accurate approximation for the multiproduct case. This approximated formulation allows us to optimize inventory decisions by solving a fractional integer program with a fixed point equation constraint. When products have equal margins, we solve the integer program exactly by bisection over a one-dimensional parameter. In contrast, when products have different margins, we propose a fractional relaxation that we can also solve by bisection and that results in near-optimal solutions. Overall, our approach provides solutions within 0.1\% of the optimal policy and finds the optimal solution in 80\% of the random instances we generate.

In this article we analyze the theoretical basis for these restraints. In a setting where retailers inform consumers and are imperfectly competitive, and where a manufacturer has some monopoly power, we identify three potential externalities affecting retailers' decisions. These externalities lead to the failure of simple uniform-price contracts to coordinate the incentives of retailers with the objective of maximizing combined manufacturer and retailer profits. We identify the packages of vertical restraints that are minimally sufficient, under various conditions, to neutralize the externalities and to achieve the joint-profit maximum.},

However, it is also important to study vertical contracts empirically in order to gain insight into the relative size of different types of efficiency gains. In this paper, I empirically analyse a contractual innovation in the vertically separated video rental industry. Prior to 1998, video stores obtained inventory from movie distributors using simple linear-pricing contracts. In 1998, revenue-sharing contracts were widely adopted. I investigate the effect of the introduction of revenue-sharing contracts on firms' profits and consumer welfare. I analyse a new panel data set of home video retailers that includes information on individual retailers' contract and inventory choices, as well as rentals and contract terms for 246 movie titles and 6137 retailers in the U.S. during each week of 1998 and 1999 and the first half of 2000. A structural econometric model of firms' behaviour is developed that describes the nature of firms' contract choices. Estimates from this model indicate that both upstream and downstream profits increase by 10\% under the revenue-sharing contract for popular titles. For less popular titles, the effects can be even larger. I also estimate that consumers benefit when revenue-sharing contracts are adopted.},

In classical inventory theory, a unit stockout penalty cost has been used as a surrogate to mimic the economic effect of such a departure; in this study, we explicitly represent this aspect of consumer behavior, incorporating the diminishing effect of the consumers leaving the market upon the stochastic demand distribution in a time-dynamic context. The initial model considers a single firm. We allow for consumer forgiveness where customers may flow back to the committed purchasing market from a nonpurchasing ``latent'' market. The per-period decisions include a marketing mix to attract latent and new consumers to the committed market and the setting of inventory levels. We establish conditions under which the firm optimally operates a base-stock inventory policy. The subsequent two models consider a duopoly where the potential market for a firm is now the committed market of the other firm; each firm decides its own inventory level. In the first model, the only decisions are the stocking decisions and in the second model, a firm may also advertise to attract dissatisfied customers from its competitor's market. In both cases, we establish conditions for a base-stock equilibrium policy. We demonstrate comparative statics in all models.},

We give conditions under which the stationary infinite-horizon equilibrium is also a Markov perfect (closed-loop) equilibrium. These conditions are then applied to three specific duopolies. The first application is one with stockout-based substitution, where the firms face independent direct demand but some fraction of a firm's lost sales will switch to the other firm. The second application is one where shelf-space display stimulates primary demand and reduces demand for the other firm's product. The final application is one where the state variables represent goodwill rather than inventory. These specific problems have been previously studied in both the single period and/or stationary infinite-horizon (open-loop) settings but not in Markov perfect (closed-loop) settings. Under the Markov perfect setting, a variety of interesting dynamics may occur, including that there may be a so-called commitment value to inventory.},

Evidence was found to suggest that a double marginalization problem is likely to exist within Korea's telecommunication industry as it is presently structured, and that this problem is further likely to have an adverse effect on the industry by inflating the price of fixed-to-mobile calls. Two alternatives are proposed to effectively remedy this double marginalization issue. It is also shown that prices of fixed-to-mobile calls could be lowered by changing the caller pays principle into a receiver pays principle.},

The best attainable contract has vertical externalities in both nonprice choices and the choice of consumers' price if delegated to the retailer. RPM controls the latter externality but interacts with the other externalities as well. As a consequence, either minimum or maximum vertical price fixing can be optimal in spite of a successive-monopoly specification. Similar incentives exist for writing other variables into contract, such as the capital input of the retailer.},

The existence of an equilibrium point for such a game is shown. By requiring appropriate concavity in the payoff functions a concave game is defined. It is proved that there is a unique equilibrium point for every strictly concave game. A dynamic model for nonequilibrium situations is proposed. This model consists of a system of differential equations which specify the rate of change of each player's strategy. It is shown that for a strictly concave game the system is globally asymptotically stable with respect to the unique equilibrium point of the game. Finally, it is shown how a gradient method suitable for a concave mathematical programming problem can be used to find the equilibrium point for a concave game.},

A simple linear demand system is used and is linked to preferences of consumers via a discrete-choice approach. Under this specification, and in contrast to the literature dealing with this case, RPM may increase service (and price) or decrease service (and price). More interestingly, whether service increases or decreases due to RPM provides no clue to whether welfare increases or decreases due to RPM. Either case may arise independently of the effect of RPM on service.}

More interestingly social welfare is reduced by RPM (at least locally) exactly under those circumstances where RPM induces higher service (and price). Hence, welfare decreases exactly in the case which was frequently presented for the justification of RPM to promote service.},

However, if the individual supplier-retailer wholesale price terms are unobservable by competitors, then resale price maintenance will be seen, but the coverage will not be universal. The equilibria can be ranked by the usual social welfare criteria. Resale price maintenance, though worse than simple marginal cost wholesale pricing, yields greater surplus than the slotting allowance equilibrium.},

In particular, the (expected) channel profit loss, compared with that of a centralized system, increases with demand price elasticity and decreases with retailer's cost share, while the profit share extracted by the retailer decreases with price elasticity and increases with retailer's cost share. With an iso-price-elastic demand model, we show that the channel profit loss cannot exceed 26.4\%, and that the retailer's profit share cannot be below 50\%. When price elasticity is low, or when the retailer's cost share approaches 100\%, or both, the retailer can extract nearly all the channel profit that is almost equal to the centralized channel profit.},

  abstract = {We analyze a manufacturer's e-channel decision problem in which the manufacturer selects a direct-sales channel or a third-party consignment channel to complement his existing physical retail channel. We accordingly investigate two possible dual channels: a PD system involving a physical channel and a direct e-channel, and a PC system consisting of a physical channel and a consignment e-channel. For each system, we examine both a sequential-move game and a simultaneous-move game, as the manufacturer can strategically decide to announce his pricing decision before the physical retailer or to make his pricing decision with no communication with the physical retailer. Our analytical results indicate that, if the manufacturer's unit operating cost in the direct e-channel or the e-tailer's revenue allocation ratio in the consignment e-channel is sufficiently small, then the manufacturer has an incentive to adopt an e-channel. The manufacturer can always gain a higher profit by announcing his pricing decision before the physical retailer. If the manufacturer aims at increasing the demand, then he may choose the simultaneous-move game. Moreover, when the manufacturer selects an e-channel to increase his profit, he should adopt a direct e-channel if his unit e-channel operating cost is below a certain threshold that is dependent on the e-tailer's revenue allocation ratio, and adopt a consignment e-channel otherwise. A similar managerial insight is drawn when the manufacturer intends to increase the demand.},

The setup is a symmetric duopoly with product differentiation and a perfectly competitive retail market. In the game with unconstrained price competition, there is price dispersion in the retail market. In the game with resale price maintenance (RPM), manufacturers' profits are higher, retail inventories are at least as high, and total surplus is at least as high. The effect of RPM on consumer surplus is ambiguous. RPM also precludes possible coordination failure between the manufacturers.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) agreements in Europe by studying a legally-permitted form of RPM in the book market. In particular, we study the effects of such agreements on prices and sales, finding that countries which have Fixed Book Prices policies witness higher book sales, relative to countries without such a policy, with no noticeable effect on the average price of books. We suggest the mechanism for these findings is that FBP policies promote non-price competition and a diverse network of retailers, increasing quantity, whilst a change in bargaining power reduces double marginalisation, offsetting upward pricing pressure from RPM. Whilst these results are limited to the book sector, and are based on a limited number of countries changing policy, they nonetheless highlight that RPM agreements have the ability to confer positive competition effects and absolute prohibition of such agreements may not always be warranted.},

  abstract = {E-commerce is the fastest growing subsector within retail trade, yet the exact nature of competition between physical stores and the online channel is thinly studied empirically. Following a period of rapid growth, national aggregate establishment counts for the bookstore industry declined by over 40\% between 1994 and 2012. I measure the differential effect of online competition on brick-and-mortar bookstores, using unique establishment-level data from 1987 to 2012 combined with measures of e-commerce levels from Forrester Research's Technographics Survey. To trace out the impact of e-commerce, I exploit geographic and temporal variation in the level of online activities. I find that online competition has a larger negative effect on large chain stores than on single-unit stores. Furthermore, bookstores that were the most insulated from online competition are precisely the stores that sell a wide array of products outside of books, such as food, gift cards, and clothing. In response to surging online competition, stores have expanded their non-book product offerings over time. However, the largest bookstore chains were still most negatively impacted given that they were relatively inefficient at non-book retailing. I develop a dynamic oligopoly model of the bookstore industry to quantify the effect of online retail on equilibrium market structure. One implication of the model is that the rise of online competition has disproportionately reduced long-run profitability for the large chains by over 30\% in the last time period of study, despite their non-book presence increasing the most over time.},

The contracts also imposed quantity floors, a practice already in use before the regulatory change. The introduction of standards suggests that, consistent with a view of vertical restraints as coordination mechanisms, manufacturers used exclusive territories to induce desired dealer services, and, once the use of exclusive territories was prohibited, they switched to alternative contractual devices to achieve this goal. The introduction of price ceilings despite free intrabrand competition also suggests that car manufacturers tried to prevent some dealers from gaming the quantity floors by selling to other dealers' customers while charging monopolistic prices at their own locations.},
