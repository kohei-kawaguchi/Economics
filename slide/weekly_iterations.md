# Weekly Iterations

Development approach: work organized into one-week cycles with clear goals and deliverables.

---

# Why Weekly Iterations?

- Manageable scope
- Regular checkpoints for feedback
- Predictable cadence
- Quick learning for new members
- Visible progress
- Adaptability to changing priorities

---

# The Weekly Cycle

1. Set clear objectives (research, modeling, development, docs)
2. Execute plan
3. Review and integrate (test, verify, consolidate)
4. Reflect and plan next iteration

---

# Getting Started

1. First week: Understand scope, complete small task
2. Early iterations: Work closely with experienced members
3. Growing responsibility: More complex tasks
4. Full participation: Lead planning, contribute to retrospectives

---

# Best Practices: Balanced Focus

Advance all areas each week: research, modeling, code, documentation. No area neglected too long.

---

# Integration of Work Streams

- Connect empirical findings to theoretical models
- Translate models into implementations
- Document properties and foundations
- Ensure empirical work tests theory

---

# Quality Standards

- Rigor in methodology
- Mathematical precision
- Robust testing
- Clear documentation
- Peer review

---

# Communication

- Share progress regularly
- Raise blockers early
- Document decisions
- Ask when unclear
- Explain assumptions and limitations
- Use Discord for quick collaboration

---

# Continuous Improvement

Each week advances understanding. Address gaps incrementally. Refine processes based on learning.
