# Weekly Iterations for Economic Codebase Development

## What Are Weekly Iterations?

Weekly iterations are a development approach where work is organized into one-week cycles. Each cycle has a clear beginning and end, with specific goals set at the start and results delivered by the end. This methodology promotes consistent progress, regular feedback, and a sustainable development pace.

## Why Weekly Iterations?

For new team members joining our economic codebase development:

- **Manageable Scope**: Breaking work into weekly chunks prevents overwhelming complexity
- **Regular Checkpoints**: Weekly milestones provide natural points for feedback and course correction
- **Predictable Cadence**: Establishes a reliable rhythm for the team's work
- **Quick Learning**: New team members can rapidly integrate through small, complete cycles
- **Visible Progress**: Demonstrates momentum and continuous improvement
- **Adaptability**: Allows for changing priorities with minimal disruption

## The Weekly Iteration Cycle

Each weekly iteration follows this pattern:

1. **Set Clear Objectives**: Define what will be accomplished this week
2. **Implement Changes**: Develop the code needed to meet objectives
3. **Review and Integrate**: Test changes and merge them into the main codebase
4. **Reflect and Plan**: Evaluate the week's work and prepare for the next iteration

## Getting Started with Weekly Iterations

As you join our team:

1. **First Week**: Focus on understanding the codebase and completing a small, well-defined task
2. **Early Iterations**: Work closely with experienced team members who can guide your approach
3. **Growing Responsibility**: Gradually take on more complex tasks in subsequent iterations
4. **Full Participation**: Eventually lead your own weekly planning and contribute to team retrospectives

## Best Practices for Weekly Iterations

### Focus on Deliverables
Define clear, concrete outputs for each week. Prioritize completing a few things well over starting many things.

### Maintain Quality Standards
- Write tests for new code
- Document your work
- Follow established code conventions
- Conduct code reviews

### Communication
- Share progress regularly
- Raise blockers early
- Document decisions and rationale
- Ask questions when unclear about priorities

### Continuous Improvement
- Each week should leave the codebase better than you found it
- Address technical debt incrementally
- Refine processes based on what you learn

## Adapting to Project Needs

Weekly iterations provide structure, but flexibility is essential:

- **Scope Adjustment**: Some weeks may require focusing on fewer, more complex tasks
- **Collaborative Work**: Coordinate with team members when working on interconnected components
- **Learning Time**: Budget time for research and skill development when needed

## Conclusion

Weekly iterations provide a foundation for productive, sustainable codebase development. By embracing this approach, you'll quickly integrate with our team's workflow while contributing meaningfully to our economic codebase.
