# Weekly Iterations for Economic Research and Development

## What Are Weekly Iterations?

Weekly iterations are a development approach where work is organized into one-week cycles. Each cycle has a clear beginning and end, with specific goals set at the start and results delivered by the end. This methodology promotes consistent progress, regular feedback, and a sustainable pace for research, analytical modeling, and development activities.

## Why Weekly Iterations?

For new team members joining our economic research and development work:

- **Manageable Scope**: Breaking work into weekly chunks prevents overwhelming complexity
- **Regular Checkpoints**: Weekly milestones provide natural points for feedback and course correction
- **Predictable Cadence**: Establishes a reliable rhythm for the team's work
- **Quick Learning**: New team members can rapidly integrate through small, complete cycles
- **Visible Progress**: Demonstrates momentum and continuous improvement
- **Adaptability**: Allows for changing priorities with minimal disruption

## The Weekly Iteration Cycle

Each weekly iteration follows this pattern:

1. **Set Clear Objectives**: Define what will be accomplished this week across research, modeling, development, and documentation
2. **Execute Plan**: Conduct surveys, develop models, implement code, and write documentation
3. **Review and Integrate**: Test changes, verify model results, and consolidate documentation
4. **Reflect and Plan**: Evaluate the week's work and prepare for the next iteration

## Getting Started with Weekly Iterations

As you join our team:

1. **First Week**: Focus on understanding the project scope and completing a small, well-defined task
2. **Early Iterations**: Work closely with experienced team members across research, modeling, coding, and documentation
3. **Growing Responsibility**: Gradually take on more complex tasks in subsequent iterations
4. **Full Participation**: Eventually lead your own weekly planning and contribute to team retrospectives

## Best Practices for Weekly Iterations

### Balanced Focus
Define clear objectives that advance all areas of the project (research, modeling, code, documentation) each week. Ensure no area is neglected for too long.

### Integration of Work Streams
- Connect empirical research findings to theoretical model development
- Translate mathematical models into computational implementations
- Document model properties and theoretical foundations
- Ensure empirical work tests or informs theoretical predictions

### Maintain Quality Standards
- Rigor in research methodology
- Mathematical precision in model development
- Robust testing for code and theoretical results
- Clear, accurate documentation
- Peer review across all deliverables

### Communication
- Share progress regularly
- Raise blockers early
- Document decisions and rationale
- Ask questions when unclear about priorities
- Clearly explain model assumptions and limitations
- Use chat apps like Discord for quick within-week collaboration, code sharing, and informal updates

### Continuous Improvement
- Each week should advance our understanding and capabilities
- Address theoretical gaps and model refinements incrementally
- Refine processes based on what you learn

## Conclusion

Weekly iterations provide a foundation for productive, sustainable economic research and development. By embracing this approach, you'll quickly integrate with our team's workflow while contributing meaningfully across research, economic modeling, code development, and documentation.
